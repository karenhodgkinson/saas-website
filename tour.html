      <p>"We believe that ANYONE can sell online!”</p>
      <p>-–Bob Clarn, founder</p>

        <p>Bob Clarn learned the hard way that selling online can be daunting.</p>
        <p>When you’re new to the world of online sales, going alone can be tough. In 2006, Bob Clarn was the owner of Classic Knitting Supplies Inc., a company that sold vintage sewing, knitting, and crocheting materials. He wanted to branch out and start selling online, but the processs turned out to be much more difficult than he anticipated. Shipping, social media, website design, and managing sales accounts were just a few of the difficulties he encountered. By talking to fellow online retailers, he discovered that he was not alone: many people struggle to break into the online market. Small business owners have enough to worry about without learning how to design a website! Bob wanted to find a way to make is easier to realize your vision.</p>
